# AutoScout24_ML and Deployment

## What is this project?

- Our aim in the project was to make a vehicle price estimation and to find the ***best machine learning model*** by using the ML models we learned before, and then to provide a price estimation by entering the features of the vehicle they want with a convenient interface to the user via ***Streamlit***.

## How was this project done and what tools were used?

- In this project, we used the ***AutoScout24 dataset***, which we made suitable for machine learning in the previous project.
- We completed this project with my other ***3 teammates*** in a period of ***20 days***.
- We applied ***Agile Scrum methodology*** during the project process. In this way, we were able to control our progress and also exchanged ideas.
- We used ***Github, Streamlit, Python*** and ***VSCode*** in the project

## My roles in the project:
* With our data, we got the best result with the ***LightGBM*** model and we were able to evaluate the success percentage of our model (***R2_Score***: 0.9299121883714698, ***RMSE***: 4987.308372465147).
* Then we presented our ***vehicle price estimation project*** to the user via ***Streamlit***.
* You can use this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/mhmtnzly/autoscout-deploy-ml/main/autoscout_deploy.py) for vehicle estimation :)

## Results;
* With this project, I stepped into the world of ***Machine Learning*** :)
* I learned the basic logic behind machine learning models and realized how important statistics are for machine learning.
